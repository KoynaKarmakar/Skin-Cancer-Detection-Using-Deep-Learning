Skin Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for early skin cancer detection using the ISIC 2024 dataset. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the ResNet50 architecture, the model classifies skin lesions into benign or malignant categories based on image analysis.
